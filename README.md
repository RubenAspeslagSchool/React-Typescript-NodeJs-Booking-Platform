# React-Typescript-NodeJs-Booking-Platform

🧱 Architecture:

Client Web App (React + TypeScript)
For users to browse locations, book spaces, and manage their reservations.

Backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
Handles authentication, bookings, availability, payments, and notifications.

🔗 Communication:

All apps communicate with the backend via REST APIs.
Realtime updates via WebSockets or Socket.IO (e.g., for admin to see live bookings).
Optional: add email notifications (NodeMailer).
